A high frequency Mark Six / Lotto
----

So now we are building a very high frequency Mark Six/Lotto. 

In this Mark Six/Lotto, we are accepting tickets constantly. Every x seconds there will be a draw and there will be 1 winner. Implement a system that accept requests as contestant of the draw. And we will response to requesters wins or not in the end of x seconds.

You can use whatever tools / language you prefer. But we are using Ruby on Rails.
