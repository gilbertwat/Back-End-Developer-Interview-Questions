Mark Six
----

So now we are building a lottery system similar to Mark Six in Hong Kong. 

In this system, we are selling tickets and perform the draws continuously.

Tickets are sold when contestants call our system.

Every ticket is unique.

Every __x__ seconds there will be a draw and there will be only *1* winner. 

And the system will response to contestants whether they win or not at the end of __x__ seconds.

You can use whatever tools / language you prefer. But we are using Ruby on Rails.

You must write codes to validate your system, for example using JUnit, Gherkins or other testing framework of your choice.

Your system should be able to deploy in 1 command without using superuser privileges.

Also outline the limitation of your system and how you will improve it (if you have time).

Take a reasonable timeframe to complete the project. It should not take longer than 2 working days.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact dev.platform@gogotech.hk
