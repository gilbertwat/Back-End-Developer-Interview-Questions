Mark Six
----

So now we are building a Mark Six(Lottery) system. 

In this system, we are selling tickets and perform the draws continuously.

Tickets are sold when contestants call our system.

Every __x__ seconds there will be a draw and there will be only *1* winner. 

And the system will response to requesters whether they win or not at the end of __x__ seconds.

You can use whatever tools / language you prefer. But we are using Ruby on Rails.

Your system should be able to be tested automatically.

Also outline the limitation of your system and how you will improve it (if you have time).

Take a reasonable timeframe to complete the project. It should not take longer than 2 working days.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact dev.platform@gogotech.hk
